# Nurse Assistant for Disease Diagnostic

## Objective

Our project aims to create a smartphone/tablet application to help reception nurses diagnose quickly the patient's illness.
Let's imagine together the following scenario: A patient arrives on Sunday evening and the emergency department is overwhelmed. The nurse in charge of the reception points him to the bad service and his time of care is considerably lengthened.
To remedy this problem: The nurse in charge of the reception will be able to inform in our application NADD: Nurse Assistant Disease Diagnostic the symptoms of which the patient suffers, and our application will return to him the illness of which the patient suffers.
We have chosen to use a simple design to make it easier for nurses to use.
